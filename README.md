Hello, this is a java program for "Xs and Os", commonly known as tic tac toe. The code is easy to run. Simply launch two versions of the code in your IDE, type in your IP and Port number (port number must be the same), and then you can play your game! 

The game must be restarted after a draw or win/loss.

Thank you for reading
